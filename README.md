# 📊 Market Campaign Analysis  
### End-to-End Marketing Analytics using Google Looker Studio

---

## 🧩 Business Problem

Organizations execute marketing campaigns across multiple digital channels such as **Search, Social Media, Email, Display, and Influencer marketing**.  
While these campaigns generate large volumes of data, stakeholders often lack a **single, reliable, real-time analytics view** to answer critical business questions:

- Which campaigns and channels generate the highest engagement and ROI?
- How effectively is the marketing budget being utilized?
- Which target audience segments respond best to specific campaign types?
- Where should marketing spend be optimized across regions and channels?

Without a centralized analytics solution, decision-making becomes reactive, budget allocation inefficient, and growth opportunities are missed.
